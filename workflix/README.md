# Workflow and Branches

We use GitHub issues for managing our project.
* When you start working on an issue, create a new branch based on the current master with a corresponding name.
For example, when you're working on `Issue 42: Make the world run`, use the branch name `42-MakeWorldRun`.
* Once you've finished the issue, open a PR on GitHub to merge the code into the master branch.
* When merging the PR, use a merge commit; don't use a squash commit.

*Definition of Done*:
* The functionality of the user story has to be implemented
* Unit tests for backend functionalities have to exist
* Integration tests for REST Api are desirable
